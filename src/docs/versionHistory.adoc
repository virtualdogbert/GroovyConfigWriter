== Version History
* 1.0
** People have been using it for quite a while with no major complaints, so it's time to kick it to 1.0 with some updates
** Added in a asClosure option, which defaults to true, however, it you change it to false you will get a map based output instead.
** Updated the dependencies, and made them compileOnly, so in your script/application you will have to provide your own:
***'org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:2.5.4',
***'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.6.1',
***'ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:0.9.28'
* 0.2
** A user wanted Java 7 support so I dropped the requirement that it was a Java 8 lib back to 7. However the next release will be for java 8+
* 0.1
** Initial Release looking for feedback.
