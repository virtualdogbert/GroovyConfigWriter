== Introduction

This Library is  a config writer for the groovy format used, by the config
slurper. I don't make any claims that this covers all edge cases, in fact there are a few hacks to
make this work with a sample from Grails application.yml. If you come across edge cases that don't
work be sure to raise an issue on github:

I wrote this to be used in a script to provide a conversion from yml to groovy, which I though there
should be, because I find the groovy format to be more flexible, and readable, then yml. I found it
Strange when Graeme Rocher said:
"But to answer the question more concretely we wanted a format that is machine writeable as well as readableï»¿"

Surely since there is a Config Slurper, there has to be a config writer right? Well I was wrong, partially...
There is something, but it is limited, and didn't provide the closure based syntax.
